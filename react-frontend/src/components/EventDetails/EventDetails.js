              A recent Sunday evening I squeezed into a tiny movie theater
              tucked inside a residential neighborhood in Brooklyn to see a
              documentary film. The space was a bit musty and the radiator was
              spitting out too much heat, but there was something delightfully
              retro about it, right down to the occasional technical glitch with
              the film. If I hadn’t known better, I might have thought I was
              back in college, watching films like Godard’s Alphaville and F.W.
              Murnau’s Nosferatu on 16-millimeter projectors that were forever
              breaking down or slipping out of focus. The reason for the random
              location was that back in October, another Brooklyn venue
              cancelled — with mere hours notice — the second of two screenings
              of the same film. That might seem strange, considering that the
              previous showing had attracted a sold-out crowd, but the subject
              of the film was Jordan Peterson, the controversial Canadian
              psychologist-turned-guru and philosopher. Though there was no sign
              of audience distress during the film, some of the venue’s staffers
              said they had felt uncomfortable while watching it. So their boss
              called off the show. The Rise of Jordan Peterson has become a
              prime example of the same kind of distortions and informational
              silo-ing that fuels the discussion around its cantankerous
              subject. The Rise of Jordan Peterson, the debut feature by
              Toronto-based filmmaker Patricia Marcoccia, officially premiered
              in September. But its rollout has happened in fits and starts,
              mostly because the deeply polarizing nature of its subject has
              made theaters reluctant to show it. Peterson had a long career as
              a relatively obscure academic until a few years ago, when he
              became hugely popular for sometimes troubling reasons. In 2016, he
              posted a YouTube video in which he explained his opposition to a
              parliamentary bill that he said could potentially punish people
              who refuse to use gender neutral pronouns like “ze” and “zir” or
              the singular “they.” The video went viral and made Peterson a hero
              of the anti-P.C. crowd. At that time, filmmaker Patricia Marcoccia
              happened to already be more than a year into the process of making
              a documentary about a very different side of Peterson. She’d first
              become interested in his work when she read his 1999 book, Maps of
              Meaning, as an undergraduate more than a decade earlier. In 2015,
              she approached Peterson about shooting a film about his friendship
              with Charles Joseph, a woodcarver from the indigenous Kwakiutl
              people of British Columbia. That film, which Marcoccia says she
              intends to go back and finish, chronicled the process of Peterson
              working with Charles on a Kwakiutl-inspired renovation to his
              Toronto house. It also showed Peterson and his wife participating
              in Kwakiutl ceremonies to which they’d been invited as guests. It
              was about the farthest thing imaginable from a scandal spawned by
              YouTube. The scandal came out of nowhere and as a left-leaning
              progressive, Marcoccia recoiled from it. Nonetheless, she kept the
              camera rolling. By then she was working with her producing partner
              and eventual husband, Maziar Ghaderi, and the two remained
              embedded in Peterson’s life as the project took a radical turn.
              I’m not going to devote a lot of space here trying to explain what
              Peterson stands for (insofar as anyone can explain it.) I wrote
              about him earlier this year regarding his and other YouTube
              figures’ algorithmic proximities to the white nationalist who
              murdered 51 people and injured 49 others at two mosques in New
              Zealand and that is still pretty much the extent of what I have to
              say on the man. What I will say is that The Rise of Jordan
              Peterson is as clear a depiction of the culture’s current
              resistance to complexity of thought as any I’ve seen. That goes
              not just for what’s shown in the film, but also how the film was
              shown — or in some cases not shown — to the public. Quite by
              accident (though perhaps it was actually a self-fulfilling
              prophecy) The Rise of Jordan Peterson has become a prime example
              of the same kind of distortions and informational silo-ing that
              fuels the discussion around its cantankerous subject. The original
              Brooklyn venue wasn’t the only one to cancel screenings of the
              film. In September, the Carlton Theater in Toronto axed what had
              been scheduled to be a weeklong run. Another theater in Toronto
              bowed out as well. And in Portland, Or., a pastor received death
              threats after arranging a screening in his church. He hired extra
              security and went ahead and showed the film anyway. In and of
              itself, the (literal) cancelation story only goes so far.
              Marccocia and Ghaderi have said they’re tired of talking about it
              and wish the press would engage with the film artistically (like,
              for instance, by reviewing it) rather than just report on its
              controversy. There’s also the fact that the film, unsurprisingly,
              is doing quite well on streaming services. It hit number one on an
              iTunes chart in the United States and Canada, in addition to being
              in the documentary top five on Amazon for weeks. But the real
              story, to me at least, has to do with the ways cultural
              gatekeepers in the film world and beyond seem to be falling down
              on the job. Whereas we once entrusted our arts institutions to
              highly trained specialists whose authority lay in their expertise
              and taste, today’s cultural arbiters often find themselves going
              along to get along. In the process, they risk defeating the very
              purpose of their job, which is to discern good art from bad art
              and to know what’s propaganda and what’s not. The Rise of Jordan
              Peterson is not a propaganda film. It’s a film about propaganda.
              It’s about the way facts have become helpless in the face of
              distortive framing. Moreover, it’s about the way Peterson,
              consciously or not, has become complicit in his own distortions.
              “I think he doesn’t see that when he’s fighting this battle
              [against those who mischaracterize him] he’s actually falling
              victim to the exact same things that he’s accusing them of,”
              Peterson’s friend and colleague, University of Toronto psychology
              professor, Wil Cunningham, says at one point. That sort of point
              is made enough times in the film so that anyone in the job of
              programming movies in an art house, regardless of their
              preconceptions about the subject matter, should be able to see
              that it’s up to something far more ambitious than promoting a
              particular figure. Moreover, anyone who’s in that job should be
              able to tell junior staff members who can’t make that distinction
              to look a little closer and maybe learn a thing or two about
              cinema since they happen to be working at one. But in many ways
              that’s the old school version of cultural gatekeeping, a relic
              from when we looked to cultural gatekeepers for connoisseurship.
              Today, much of gatekeeping involves knowing how and when to cover
              your ass. In the fall of 2018, New Yorker editor David Remnick
              learned this the hard way. When it was announced that Remnick had
              invited former Trump advisor Steve Bannon to the New Yorker
              Festival with the intention of interviewing him on stage (and,
              presumably in his mind, to use highbrow enhanced interrogation
              techniques to peel back the layers of Bannon’s odiousness as never
              before) the backlash from many magazine staffers and festival
              participants was so swift and vociferous that Remnick reversed
              course and rescinded the invitation. The capitulation led to a
              whole new round of criticism (for my part, I was sorry not to have
              the chance to see Bannon publicly flayed) but given the current
              rules for cultural arbitration, Remnick probably did the right
              thing. After all, look what happened at the Whitney Museum.
              Plagued by controversy stemming from a board member’s business
              interests in tear gas manufacturing, things got so heated that by
              the time the Whitney Biennial rolled around last summer, more
              attention was paid to which artists were dropping out than to the
              art itself. (This is not to be confused with the Whitney
              Biennial’s 2017 dustup, in which controversy over racially charged
              painting dominated dicsussion of the whole show.) Similar
              discussions have taken place over the numerous arts institutions
              funded by the Sackler Family, whose philanthropy is made possible
              in no small part by investments in the pharmaceutical companies
              that many blame for the opioid crisis. Like the Whitney artists,
              celebrity participants in the New Yorker Festival were promising
              to drop out if Bannon stayed on the bill. Given the way the
              digital landscape has made legacy cultural institutions more
              precarious than ever, you could argue that bowing to pressure in
              order to preserve the kinds of revenue streams generated by big
              ticket festivals ultimately helps the arts more than it hurts
              them. That is to say, Remnick made a fiscally responsible decision
              that sought to protect the magazine. Fair enough. But it’s one
              thing for stewards of the arts to respond to consumer pressures
              and quite another to use politics as an excuse not to showcase
              material that doesn’t fall neatly into an ideological camp.
              “Theater programmers told us there is no market for nuanced
              films,” Gadheri told me when I met with him and Marcoccia at a
              diner near Columbia University last week before they showed their
              film to a student group on campus. He explained how one theater
              considered showing the film with a roundtable discussion
              afterwards in which both sides would be represented. But the
              committee decided that having both sides present made it an unsafe
              environment.
