            <h3>Effective Date</h3>
            <p>
              This Policy applies to all information collected by or provided to
              us in connection with the Service. When we make any material
              changes to this Policy, we will change the Effective Date above

            <h3>Third Parties</h3>
            <p>
              The Service may contain, and we may send to registered users,
              links to third-party websites. This Policy does not apply to
              information that you may provide to or that may be collected by
              third parties. We encourage you to request that such third parties
              provide you with their applicable privacy policies and other terms
              and conditions before engaging with or making a purchase from such
              third parties.

            <h3>Collected Information</h3>
            <h4>Information You Submit</h4>
            <p>
              {" "}
              When you log-in to or create an account with the Service, we
              collect the information you provide in the applicable forms. This
              information includes personally identifiable information such as
              your name, e-mail address and password. Information you submit to
              the Service also includes content that you create and publish on
              the Service, which will include such personally identifiable
              information as you may choose to include. When we refer to
              “personally identifiable information” in this Policy, we mean
              information that we can directly associate with a specific person
              or entity without additional information. To the extent you
              decline to share certain personally identifiable information with
              us, we may not be able to provide some or all of the features and
              functionalities found on the Service.
            </p>

            <h4>Information Collected Automatically</h4>
            <p>
              When you use the Service, we automatically gather certain
              non-personally identifiable information from you. This includes
              usage information, such as information on when, how often and for
              how long you use the Service and the content you submit and view.
              This also includes server log data such as the IP address or
              operating system, or the webpage you were visiting before you came
              to our Service. As described below, we collect this information
              through a number of means, including server logs, cookies and
              other online tracking mechanisms. We may associate such
              non-personally identifiable information with the personally
              identifiable information that you provide in connection with the
              Service. But if we do so, we will treat the combined information
              as personally identifiable information.{" "}
            </p>

            <h4>Analytics Services</h4>
            <p>
              We use certain third-party services to assist us in analysis,
              auditing, research, and reporting regarding the Service. These
              third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set
              and access cookies on your computer or other device. In
              particular, we use Amplitude to help collect and analyze certain
              information for the purposes discussed in this Policy.
            </p>

            <h4>Online Tracking and Cookies</h4>
            <p>
              The Service may use web beacons, cookies and other online tracking
              mechanisms to collect information. "Beacons" (also often referred
              to as "pixels") are tiny graphics on a web page designed to track
              when a page is viewed. Beacons also can be inserted into emails in
              order to track certain information, including whether an email has
              been opened. "Cookies" are small text files containing a string of
              alphanumeric characters that are downloaded by your web browser or
              mobile device when you visit a website. We may use both session
              cookies and persistent cookies when you access and use the
              Service. Cookies may be used, for example, to remember your user
              account information and your preferences, to customize the
              interface of the Service for you and to assist us in measuring and
              analyzing Service traffic. A session cookie disappears after you
              close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close
              your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits
              to the Service. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review
              your browser's documentation to learn the best way to remove
              cookies and to modify your cookie settings. You can take steps to
              limit tracking by erasing cookies from your computer's hard drive
              and by setting your browser to block all cookies or warn you
              before a cookie is stored. We partner with certain third parties
              to collect non-personally identifiable information. These third
              parties may use web logs, web beacons or other online tracking
              mechanisms, and they may set and access cookies on your computer
              or other device. Means of opting out of this third-party data
              collection are discussed below in Section 8.

            <h3>Online Behavioral Advertising</h3>
            <p>
              The Site may enable third-party tracking mechanisms to collect
              your non-personally identifiable information for use in online
              behavioral advertising. For example, third parties may use the
              fact that you visited the Site to send online ads for Company
              services to you on non-Company websites. In addition, our
              third-party advertising networks might use information about your
              use of the Site to help target non-Company advertisements based on
              your online behavior in general. For information about behavioral
              advertising practices, including privacy and confidentiality,

              The use of online tracking mechanisms by third parties is subject
              to those third parties’ own privacy policies, and not this Policy.
              If you prefer to prevent third parties from setting and accessing
              cookies on your computer, you may set your browser to block
              cookies. Additionally, you may remove yourself from the targeted
              advertising of companies within the Network Advertising Initiative
              by opting out at{" "}

              Alliance program by opting out at www.aboutads.info/choices. Like
              many websites, the Site does not currently respond to “do not
              track” browser headers, but you can limit tracking through these
              third-party programs by taking the steps discussed above.

            <h3>Transfer as Corporate Asset</h3>
