                  Women still continue to be under-represented in the workforce
                  and lack access to professional networks, mentorships,
                  guidance and even jobs. Preconceived notions on how women
                  influence a workplace or heirarchy have created barriers for
                  progress without factoring in their qualifications. While
                  there are a plethora of platforms that attempt to tackle these
                  obstacles, they fail to provide a collaborative professional
                  ecosystem that enables women to pursue their professional
                  aspirations.
